    <p>
        A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died
        July 27, 2015, Shillong),<br> Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the development of
        India’s missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was president of India from 2002 to 2007.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the
        Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research
        Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both
        designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of
        successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes was Agni, India’s
        first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.

        <h2> Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Kalam, a man who spent over five decades in public service, including one as ‘The President,’ owned
                very little.
                He didn’t have any real estate, a television, a refrigerator, a vehicle, or air conditioning, but he did
                have
                2,500 books, six shirts, a pair of shoes, a wristwatch, four pants, and three suits.</li>

            <li> Except for books, he never took presents from others.</li>

            <li>He never charged a fee for any of the talks he gave within or outside of the nation.</li>

            <li> His fascination with technology was well-known, and he kept up with all of the newest breakthroughs,
                primarily
                via radio.</li>

            <li>He was a vegetarian who was always satisfied with the food he was given.</li>

            <li>He was a devout man who made a point of saying his morning prayer every day.</li>

            <li>He never wore his faith on his sleeves, nor did he exaggerate his poor beginnings.</li>

            <li>He didn’t leave a will. What was leftover, though, was to be donated to his older brother and grandkids.
                Before
                leaving or returning from a critical mission, Kalam always contacted his older brother.</li>

            <li>‘Wings of Fire,’ his autobiography, was first published in English and has since been translated into
                thirteen
                languages, including Chinese and French.</li>

            <li>‘I Am Kalam,’ a film based on Kalam’s life, was directed by Nila Madhab Panda in 2011.</li>

        <h2>APJ Abdul Kalam Death</h2>
        On July 27, 2015, Kalam visited IIM Shillong to give a “Creating a Livable Planet Earth lecture.” He
        acknowledged considerable pain when mounting a set of steps, but he made it to the auditorium. He fainted in the
        lecture hall just five minutes into the talk, about 6:35 pm IST. In a deep state, he was brought to ‘Bethany
        Hospital.’ He was maintained in critical care, but he showed no indications of life. He was confirmed deceased
        at 7:45 p.m. IST due to cardiac arrest.

        On July 28, Kalam’s corpse was carried to New Delhi by an Indian Air Force chopper. At his apartment at 10
        Rajaji Marg, many dignitaries and the general public paid their respects to him. Kalam’s corpse was flown to
        Mandapam, where an army vehicle transported it to his hometown of Rameswaram, covered in the national flag. His
        corpse was laid out in front of a bus station in Rameswaram so that people might pay their final respects to the
        departed soul. The former President was put to rest with full state honors at Rameswaram’s Pei Karumbu Ground on
        July 30, 2015. More than 350,000 individuals attended Kalam’s last rituals.
